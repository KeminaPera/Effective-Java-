### 第13条：谨慎地覆盖clone

The Cloneable interface was intended as a mixin interface\(Item 20\) for classes to advertise that they permit cloning. Unfortunately, it fails to serve this purpose. Its primary flaw is that it lacks a clone method, and Object’s clone method is protected. You cannot, without resorting to reflection\(Item 65\), invoke clone on an object merely because it implements Cloneable. Even a reflective invocation may fail, because there is no guarantee that the object has an accessible clone method. Despite this flaw and many others, the facility is in reasonably wide use, so it pays to understand it. This item tells you how to implement a well-behaved clone method, discusses when it is appropriate to do so, and presents alternatives. So what does Cloneable do, given that it contains no methods? It determines the behavior ofObject’s protected clone implementation: if a class implements Cloneable, Object’s clone method returns a field-by-field copy of the object; otherwise it throws CloneNotSupportedException. This is a highly a typical use of interfaces and not one to be emulated. Normally, implementing an interface says something about what a class can do for its clients. In this case, it modifies the behavior of a protected method on a superclass.
