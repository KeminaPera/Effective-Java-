Historically, it was common to use naming patterns to indicate that some program elements demanded special treatment by a tool or framework. For example, prior to release 4, the JUnit testing framework required its users to designate test methods by beginning their names with the characters test\[Beck04\]. This technique works, but it has several big disadvantages. First, typographical errors result in silent failures. For example, suppose you accidentally named a test method tsetSafetyOverride instead of testSafetyOverride. JUnit 3 wouldn’t complain, but it wouldn’t execute the test either, leading to a false sense of security.
